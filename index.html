  <h1>Numerology Calculator</h1>

  <p class="pfont">Numerology dictates, that when you are born, you are endowed with four Personal 
    Numbers. These numbers will help guide you with the lessons you are to learn 
    throughout your life, and the path of your spirit. They are the <em>Life 
    Lesson Number</em>, the <em>Soul Number</em>, the <em>Outer Personality 
    Number</em>, and the <em>Path of Destiny Number</em>.
  </p>

  <p class="pfont">For a formal knowledge of the subject matter, I would highly recommend reading
    <u>Numerology and The Divine Triangle</u> by Faith Javane and Dusty Bunker.
